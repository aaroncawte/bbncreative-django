# 4. JavaScript Package Management

In order to manage the project's Javascript packages and testing in the same isolated way as its Python packages, the following steps were carried out:

1. Install nodeenv-1.3.2 to manage Node.js: `pip install nodeenv`
2. Enter `nodeenv -p --node={version}` to bind to existing Python environment
